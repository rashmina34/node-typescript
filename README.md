 Typescript is not different language, itâ€™s a flexible superset of javascript with ways to describe optional data types. All standard and valid JavaScript is also valid Typescript. Basic benefit of using typescript are to catch more errors during development and make it easier to work with your code bases.

 As soon as you add the Typescript compiler or plugin to your code, there is immediate safety and productivity benefits. Typescript alert you to misspelled functions and properties, detect passing the wrong types of arguments or the wrong number of arguments to functions, and provide smarter autocomplete suggestions.
